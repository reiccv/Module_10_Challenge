# Module 10 Challenge


## Challenge: Crypto Clustering

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

- [Import the Data](#import the data)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results

### Import the Data

This section imports the data into a new DataFrame. It follows these steps:

1. Read  the “crypto_market_data.csv” file from the Resources folder into a DataFrame, and use `index_col="coin_id"` to set the cryptocurrency name as the index. Review the DataFrame.

2. Generate the summary statistics, and use HvPlot to visualize your data to observe what your DataFrame contains.
